# PixelMan Game Maker Studio 2
This is the original source code of PixelMan Adventures I've made a long time
ago with Game Maker Studio 2.

I've decided to make it open source so that people can learn from it and
hopefully make something cool with it... well, if you can understand it because
the code is a complete mess (I was a beginner back then).


## Do you want to revive this project?
I'm not working on this project anymore in favor of the new
[Godot version](https://github.com/RobotoSkunk/PixelMan-Adventures), but if you
want to revive it, feel free to do so. I'll be happy to see what you can do
with it.
